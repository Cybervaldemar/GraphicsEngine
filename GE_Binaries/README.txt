OpenGL 4 Graphics Engine examples:
----------------------------------

Important:

- Please copy the humanoid.fbx file from the FBX SDK to the GE_Binaries folder.
  It is located in the ViewScene example folder.
  Otherwise the example will not run.

If you have a nice 3D model / FBX file, which I could use in further examples, please contact me!
